An Unity3D spaceflight arena game

The player controls a spaceship with:
Mouse for rotation and turning around
WASD for moving horizontally
Q and E rotate the ship to the left and the right respectively
CTRL lowers the ship
Spacebar makes the ship hover up
SHIFT speeds the ship up but increases the heat gauge
Left mouse button fires the ship's lasers to hit enemies or asteroids
Right mouse button puts a shield up to protect from collisions at cost of the heat gauge rising

V opens up the perk menu - the ships and asteroids the player destroys slowly accumulate experience points for the player to unlock perks such 
  as more health, speed boosts and a weapon boost

The player is limited in what they can do with the heat gauge - as long as it has not been fully filled up the player can boost their speed and fire their weapon
  however once the gauge is filled the player is left defenseless against anythng they may be up against at the moment

The enemy behaviours are as follows:
  Chase after the player to slam into the player
  Approach the player and shoot bullets that travel in real time at their position
    Has large and small variants
  Spawn several missiles that roughly chase the player - meant to saturate the area around them
  Spawn fewer missiles that accurately chase the player
    Has large and small variants
